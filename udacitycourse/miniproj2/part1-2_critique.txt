critique
1. Factors/reasons not evident
2. Pour choice of layout - overlapoing categories
3. Numbers have no meaning.
4. The circle and the weird polygon shapes were a distraction.
5. Axis Text too small
6. The rich category obscures the other two categories


How I would change it.
1. Change it into a bar chart
